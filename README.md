# Petrichor_Interpreter
A "NEW", Programming language, that was created by combining the best of C++ and Python 3. 
Still under development. Features of Petrcihor so far:
1. Basic statments
2. Can evaluate complex mathematical expressions
3. Variable handling is possible
4. If-Elseif-Else construct has been provided
5. For-Loop construct has been provided
6. Supports Methods/Function
7. Functions can take parameters and also return values
8. Recursion is possible, as you may have already guessed
9. No need to worry about making mistakes in code! We have a detailed error description 
  package built into the tool
10. Added a sleek Auto indendation feature

Features in future udpates:
1. Expanding numbers to hold more than just an integer

Later Updates:
1. A good clean WebUI, to test petrichor in action

//DrawBacks:
1. Error finding tool, is'nt as finished and complete as one we see in modern 
  interpreters, but does a good enough job to impress
2. Arrays/ classes/ have not yet been implemented
