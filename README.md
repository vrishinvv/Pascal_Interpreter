# Petrichor_Interpreter
A simple and elegant Programming language, that was created by combining the best of C++ and Python 3. 
Still under development. Features of Petrcihor so far:
1. Basic statments
2. Can evaluate complex mathematical expressions
3. Variable handling is possible
4. If-Elseif-Else construct has been provided
5. For-Loop construct has been provided

Features in future udpates:
1. Addition of Methods/Function
2. Expanding numbers to hold more than just an integer
3. Local variable name-space handling
4. Clean recursion implementation

Later Updates:
1. A good clean WebUI, to test petrichor in action
