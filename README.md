# Petrichor_Interpreter
A **NEW** Programming language, that was created by combining the best of C++ and Python 3. 
*Totally built from scratch* wihout using any dependecies or libraries
Still under development. 

### Interpeter can understand:
- [x] Basic statments
- [x] Complex mathematical expressions
- [x] If-Elseif-Else construct
- [x] For-Loop construct
- [x] Methods/Function
- [x] Parameterised Functions
- [x] Return Values

### Unique Features:
* **Local NameSpace handling** is inbuilt
* **'Recursion is possible'**, as you may have already guessed
* **'Error Description Package'** built into the tool
* Comes with a sleek **'Auto-Indendation'** feature

### Features in future udpates:
1. Expanding numbers to hold more than just an integer 

### Later Updates:
1. A good clean WebUI, to test petrichor in action

### DrawBacks:
1. Error finding tool, is'nt as finished and complete as one we see in modern 
  interpreters, but does a good enough job to impress
2. Arrays/ classes/ have not yet been implemented
